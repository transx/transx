  CREATE DATABASE transfer WITH OWNER=transxuser TABLESPACE=tableworkspace;

Note: transxuser is database username.
      transxpass is database password.
      transfer is database name.
      tableworkspace is database tablespace.
Note2: '/home/pgsql/tablespace' directory should be accessiable with psql
SUPERUSER.
      chown -R pgsql:pgsql /home/pgsql/tablespace
      chmod -R 700 /home/pgsql/tablespace
Note3: in note 2 we assumed superuser is pgsql.

production-maven-build-commands : "
To make production profiles work, I have to do some tricks:
 'mvn clean install -Pprod-only-first-time' is for production environment
  and it should be used carefully. It will drop data and insert default values.
 'mvn clean install -Pprod' is for ordinary build in production. And dbunit 
  plugin is configured to export data in xml format instead of any insertions.

 Integration-test should be activated with -Pit flag in dev mode from now on.
 'mvn clean install -Pit' (do not use it in production).
Note: above maven commands should be executed from root of parent project
(/transx/transfer).
