subject : Spring-MVC for simple RESTful support and handling JasperReports views

description : In this feature we need to configure Spring-MVC view technology
for having RESTful URLs support. First usage of this new feature would be in
refs #2 which we need to have cline-side-jasper-reports-print. With this new
feature we will be able to call reports easier with simple GET(URL) action.
