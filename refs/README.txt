refs directory is a simple place for explaining planned changes.

by passing the time we may add more conventions to this directory
but for now just let's keep it simple as every new file
should include it's reference number before it's subject.
for example following file names are OK:

0001_Refactoring dependencies and remove unused ones
0002_This is just another issue that we reference here
