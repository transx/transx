Transfer Modular JSF Web Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is ready to run as a web application. The pom.xml file is
defined with Hibernate as a persistence model and JSF as the web framework.

There are two modules in this project. The first is "core" and is meant to 
contain Services and DAOs. The second is "web" and contains any web-related
files. Using this modular archetype is recommended when you're planning on
using "core" in multiple applications, or you plan on having multiple clients
for the same backend.
